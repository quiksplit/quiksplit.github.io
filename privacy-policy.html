							<p class="text-muted mb-4">Last Updated: March 22, 2025</p>

							<div class="mb-4">
								<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Scope</h3>
								<p>Welcome to Quiksplit's Privacy Policy. Your privacy and online security are important to us. This Privacy Policy outlines how QuikSplit Ltd collects, protects, discloses, and uses your information. It applies to all Quiksplit websites, mobile applications, and online services that link to or reference this Privacy Policy, including our website at quiksplit.luistodobom.com. It covers the personal information you provide or that we collect through your use of our services and explains how we use that information in connection with Quiksplit.</p>
								
								<p>By using Quiksplit, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with any term in this Privacy Policy, please do not use our services.</p>
								
								<p><strong>Here's a Quick Overview:</strong></p>
								<ul class="mb-4">
									<li>Quiksplit is a shared ledger designed for friends, colleagues, and family to track expenses. Expenses you add in Quiksplit are not public. Friends included on an expense can view that expense, and if an expense is added to a group, other group members can see it. You decide who you share your expenses with and what expenses you share. Anyone included on an expense or in a group can edit, delete, or undelete the expenses shared with them.</li>
									<li>To use Quiksplit, you must create an account. During sign-up, we collect registration information such as your name, email address, and phone number. This information helps us create your account, contact you about it, allow your friends to find you, and enable access to your account from any device.</li>
									<li>Beyond registration data, we collect additional information like your device type and IP address, as well as details about the expenses and groups you create. We use this to improve and secure our service and to deliver personalized ads based on your usage.</li>
									<li>You control the information you provide and how we use it. We do not share your registration or personal information for marketing purposes with third parties unless outlined in this policy or with your consent. You can manage your Privacy and Notification Settings via your Account Settings page. For questions, contact us at quiksplit.app+privacy@gmail.com.</li>
								</ul>
								
								<p>Quiksplit, owned by QuikSplit Ltd (incorporated in the UK), or its partners/service providers, may process your data in the United Kingdom or other countries. By using Quiksplit and providing information, you consent to the transfer, storage, and processing of your data outside your country, including potentially outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Data protection laws in these countries may differ from those where you are located.</p>
								
								<p>Quiksplit is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian discovers their child has provided us with personal information without consent, they should contact us at quiksplit.app+privacy@gmail.com. If we learn a child under 13 has provided such information, we will delete it immediately.</p>
							</div>

							<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Data We Collect</h3>
							<p>When you use Quiksplit, we may collect the following information:</p>
							
							<p><strong>Information You Provide to Us:</strong></p>
							<ul class="mb-4">
								<li><strong>Registration Information:</strong> When you sign up for Quiksplit, we collect your name, email address, phone number, and a password. An email address and phone number are required so we can contact you about your account, allow friends to find you, and enable access from any device. Your name is displayed to friends when they add expenses with you. You can update this information anytime via your Account Settings page.</li>
								<li><strong>User-Generated Content:</strong> We collect and store data you provide while using Quiksplit to share expenses, payments, or communicate, such as group names, expense descriptions and amounts, payment details, comments, receipt images, notes, and memos. You choose who sees this data. For example, an expense shared with a group of friends is visible only to that group, not to others outside it. You are responsible for selecting who you share this information with.</li>
								<li><strong>User-Generated Invitations / Adding Users to a Group:</strong> You can invite friends to join Quiksplit or a specific group. We collect the contact information (name, email, phone number, or Quiksplit identifier) you provide for these invites. We may send a few messages on your behalf via the chosen channel, or provide a link for you to send yourself. Invitation messages may include your name, the contact's name, and the group name, as applicable.</li>
								<li><strong>Contact Book / Address Book Data:</strong> On our Android and iOS mobile apps, with your permission, we use on-device contact book data to display your contacts locally. This helps auto-fill names, emails, or phone numbers when inviting contacts to Quiksplit or a group. If permitted, only contacts you interact with in the app have their details collected by Quiksplit for sending invitations or creating profiles in your groups/friendships. We may also collect metadata, like the number of phone numbers a selected contact has.</li>
							</ul>
							
							<p><strong>Other Data We Collect:</strong></p>
							<ul class="mb-4">
								<li><strong>How You Use Our Service:</strong> We track your interactions with Quiksplit, including expense types, features used, actions taken, and activity frequency/duration. For example, we log how often you attach receipt images to improve our service or suggest features.</li>
								<li><strong>Information Shared by Others:</strong> Other Quiksplit users may share data with you using your email or phone number (e.g., adding you to an expense or group). We store this under your account based on your preferences.</li>
								<li><strong>Device and Location Information:</strong> When you use Quiksplit, we may collect device details (e.g., browser type, IP address, device identifiers, OS version) and location data to enhance security, ensure compliance, and offer location-based services like targeted ads or content.</li>
								<li><strong>Payment Information:</strong> If Quiksplit offers paid premium services, we'll collect payment details (e.g., credit/debit card info, billing details) and, for security, may request identification (e.g., name, address, phone number).</li>
								<li><strong>Third-Party Integrations:</strong> If you use optional third-party integrations (e.g., payment services), we may collect related data, such as usernames or payment statuses, to improve our service or for security/support.</li>
								<li><strong>Google Accounts:</strong> You may link your Google account to Quiksplit for login. If authorized, we may collect your name, email, and basic details (e.g., profile picture). This is optional and treated like manually provided data.</li>
								<li><strong>Contests and Surveys:</strong> Participation in voluntary promotions may involve collecting contact or marketing data, governed by specific rules if they differ from this policy.</li>
								<li><strong>Information from Other Sources:</strong> We may use public data (e.g., Gravatar avatars) or offline interactions to assist with support, fraud prevention, or personalization.</li>
								<li><strong>Other Information:</strong> Feedback, questions, or suggestions you provide help us enhance Quiksplit.</li>
							</ul>

							<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">How We Use Data</h3>

							</ul>
							
							<p><strong>With Third-Party Services:</strong></p>

							<ul class="mb-4">
								<li>Payment integrations may provide data (e.g., payment status) for completion or fraud prevention.</li>
								<li>Google Contacts access (if permitted) helps send invites, find friends, or improve services.</li>
							</ul>
							
							<p><strong>To Provide Personalized Advertisements:</strong></p>
							<p>Where allowed by law, we use your email/phone, location, usage, and expense data to show relevant ads/offers on Quiksplit (e.g., cheaper apartment ads based on rent expenses).</p>

							<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">How We Share Your Information</h3>
							<p>We will not sell, publish, or share your personal information with third parties for their marketing purposes without your permission.</p>
							
							<p>We share your data to:</p>
							
							<p><strong>Provide the Quiksplit Service:</strong></p>
							<ul class="mb-4">
								<li>Share name, email, phone number, and avatar with friends/groupmates. They can add you but only see expenses you share with them.</li>
								<li>Enable private group expense tracking, visible only to members (who can add others—your responsibility to monitor).</li>
							</ul>
							
							<p><strong>With Third Parties, Affiliates, and Service Providers:</strong></p>
							<ul class="mb-4">
								<li>We use third parties (e.g., for hosting, analytics, receipt scanning) bound by our privacy practices. With consent, we may share data otherwise.</li>
								<li>Where permitted, third parties may improve their services (e.g., OCR training with receipts).</li>
							</ul>
							
							<p><strong>For Legal Matters:</strong></p>
							<p>We may share data with law enforcement or others:</p>
							<ul class="mb-4">

								<li>To respond to third-party rights claims.</li>
								<li>In emergencies to protect users/public.</li>
								<li>As required by law.</li>
							</ul>
							
							<p><strong>Business Transfer:</strong></p>
							<p>In a merger, acquisition, or similar event, we may transfer your data to third parties, who will assume this policy's obligations.</p>
							
							<p><strong>API Usage:</strong></p>

							<p><strong>Non-Identifiable Information:</strong></p>
							<p>We may share anonymized data with third parties for research, marketing, or service improvement.</p>

							<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Security</h3>
							<p><strong>How We Protect Your Information:</strong></p>
							<p>We use encryption, authentication, and other measures to secure your data. However, no online transmission is 100% secure. You can enhance security by using encrypted networks; you're responsible for risks on unsecured ones.</p>
							
							<p>We'll notify you via email or site posting of any unencrypted data breach promptly, unless delayed by law enforcement or breach assessment needs.</p>
							
							<p><strong>Phishing:</strong></p>
							<p>We prioritize protecting you from identity theft. We never request sensitive info (e.g., credit card details, passwords) via unsolicited or insecure channels. Learn more at http://www.ftc.gov.</p>

							<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Cookies</h3>
							<p><strong>How We Use Cookies and Similar Technologies:</strong></p>
							<p>We use cookies, web beacons, and similar tools to track preferences, usage, and ad exposure, improving Quiksplit's relevance. Third-party advertisers may use these to collect data across sites for interest-based ads, without us providing identifiable info. Learn more at the Digital Advertising Alliance or Network Advertising Initiative.</p>
							
							<p>"Do Not Track" settings don't alter our practices as described here. See http://allaboutdnt.com for details.</p>
							
							<p><strong>Your Choices:</strong></p>
							<p>Disable cookies in your browser, but some features (e.g., login) may not work. Opt out of Google Analytics tracking here. Explore ad network opt-outs via the links above or device settings (e.g., Apple, Android, Windows). Opting out doesn't eliminate ads, just interest-based ones from participating networks.</p>

							<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Choice and Access; Deleting Your Account; Data Retention</h3>
							<p><strong>Choice and Access:</strong></p>
							<p>Update your info anytime via Account Settings. Export group/friendship data by contacting us.</p>
