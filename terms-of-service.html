							<h1 class="mb-4">QuikSplit Terms of Service</h1>
							<p class="text-muted mb-4">Last Updated: March 22, 2025</p>

							<div class="mb-4">
								<p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the QuikSplit service (the "Service") provided by QuikSplit Ltd. ("QuikSplit," "we," "us," or "our"), a company incorporated in the United Kingdom. By using the Service, available at quiksplit.luistodobom.com or through our mobile applications, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, please do not use the Service.</p>
								<p>QuikSplit is a shared ledger designed to help friends, colleagues, and family track expenses. The records of bills, IOUs, debts, and payments on QuikSplit are informal and not legally binding contracts. We provide the Service "as-is" without a warranty. QuikSplit is an evolving platform, and some features may not function as expected. We may discontinue or restrict certain services or features at any time. We appreciate your patience and will strive to support you to the best of our ability.</p>
								<p>We may update these Terms periodically, and the most current version will be posted at quiksplit.luistodobom.com/terms-of-service. Changes are effective immediately upon posting.</p>
							</div>

							<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">1. Who Can Use QuikSplit</h3>
							<p>You may use the Service only if you agree to these Terms and to the processing of your information as outlined in our Privacy Policy. You may not use QuikSplit if:</p>
							<ul class="mb-4">
								<li>You are barred from receiving services under the laws of the United Kingdom or any other applicable jurisdiction.</li>
								<li>We have previously banned your account for violating these Terms.</li>
								<li>You are under the age of 13.</li>
							</ul>

							<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">2. Description</h3>
							<p>QuikSplit (the "Service") is designed to help you track informal debts, expenses, and bills by allowing you to enter notes about who you owe, who owes you, and why. The Service calculates the sharing math, provides informal sharing advice, and stores this data for your convenience. You agree that the Service is provided "AS IS" and on an "AS AVAILABLE" basis.</p>

							<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">3. Informal Debts</h3>
							<p>The Service enables users who share a group or are friends on QuikSplit to post debts and payments freely, following wiki-style rules without explicit permissions. These entries are calculated into a determination of debts by the Service. You acknowledge that these debts are not legally binding and represent informal information sharing among roommates, friends, or family. QuikSplit cannot guarantee the accuracy of information entered by users, and you accept this limitation.</p>

							<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">4. Conditions of Use</h3>
							<p>You agree to:</p>

								<li>Refrain from using the Service in a fraudulent, disruptive, aggressive, manipulative, or inappropriate manner, including for money laundering.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>QuikSplit reserves the right, but is not obligated, to investigate your use of the Service to ensure compliance with these Terms. We may terminate your access to the Service at our discretion, including to comply with laws, regulations, legal processes, or government requests.</p>

							<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">5. What You Represent</h3>
							<p>You agree to:</p>
							<ul class="mb-4">
								<li>Represent yourself honestly.</li>

							</ul>

							<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">6. No Warranty</h3>
							<p>QuikSplit Ltd. does not guarantee that the Service is error-free, complete, or reliable. THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITH NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND YOU USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK. QUIKSPLIT LTD.

							<p>You may post content on QuikSplit, such as payment descriptions, comments, group/user avatars, or expense receipts.

We may, at our sole discretion, reject or remove content that violates our content standards or for any other reason we deem inappropriate. We are not obligated to monitor user content but may do so at our discretion. QuikSplit is not liable for any failure or delay in removing such content.</p>

								<li>Is obscene, harmful, abusive, or offensive (e.g., nudity is prohibited).</li>
								<li>Incites violence or hatred toward individuals or groups, particularly based on race, ethnicity, religion, nationality, disability, gender, age, veteran status, or sexual orientation/gender identity, including credible threats or hate speech.</li>
								<li>Is illegal, including content related to criminal activity, terrorism, obscenity, child pornography, human exploitation, gambling, drug use, firearms, ammunition, or piracy.</li>
